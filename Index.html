<h2> A little insight before we get started: </h2>

<p> The main purpose of this project is to use technology in a way that could help our own people. As the world is almost fully dependent on technology, I thought it would be best to learn and use this knowledge of coding into making something useful. This website consists of the steps I took to reach this point. On one hand, it's all about my learning processes, and the other is my product, which you will learn more about, soon!</p>
