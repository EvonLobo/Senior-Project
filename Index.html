<h1> Evon Lobo </h1>

<p> The topic I chose for my senior year capstone project is Web Development and Application Design. I choose the same in order to help and connect with people through technology. I am keen on learning web languages. I am also looking forward to taking up Web Development and Application Design as a career. </p>

<!-- My product will be a website that demonstrates an application I would like to develop in the future. It's solely to help people through donations. There's food that goes to waste everyday but is not used. I would like to make use of the same in order to satisfy hunger of the poor and needy. -->
